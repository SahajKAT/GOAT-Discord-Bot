# GOAT-Discord-Bot

This Discord bot efficiently fetches and analyzes data from GOAT, a specialized online store for sneakers, apparel, and accessories, using effective web scraping techniques.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python and Required Libraries:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/))
   - Install the required libraries using pip:
     ```

   - Copy the generated token and paste it into your `.env` file as `DISCORD_TOKEN`

### 3. Enable Message Intents:

   - Enable the "PRESENCE INTENT" and "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" under the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section

### 4. Adjust File References:
   - Ensure that your main Python file is named `goat_bot.py` and contains the bot logic.
   - If your bot logic is split into multiple files, ensure they are correctly imported and referenced in `discord_bot.py`.

### 5. Run the Bot:
   - Run your bot script by executing `discord_bot.py`.
   - Your bot should now be online and responding to commands prefixed with `!goat`.

### Note:
